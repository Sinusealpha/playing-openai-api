i'm using openai's api for projects and here, as a backyard of those projects, i'm gonna share some cool things that have been made for their own sake.

- step 1: i started with building a [translator](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/playing-openai-api/blob/main/translator.py) with openai's api. its idea came from the second chapter of [building llms for production](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-llms-for/9798324731472/) book. it was a great start for me to be familiar with the openai's api and gpt world.

- step 3: between the last two steps, i understood that i'd better learn the [transformers module (by hf)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index). so i watched [this course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHldQ76_k1klWQE7GyGfLH6m4iHOdVogN) and put the notebooks i wrote from it in transformer module files: [part 1](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/playing-openai-api/blob/main/transformers_module_part1.ipynb), part 2 (is coming), ...
