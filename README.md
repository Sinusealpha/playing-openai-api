# playing-openai-api
i'm using openai's api for projects and here, as a backyard of those projects, i'm gonna share some cool things that have been made for their own sake.

- step 1: i started with building a [translator](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/playing-openai-api/blob/main/translator.py) with openai's api. its idea came from the second chapter of [building llms for production](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-llms-for/9798324731472/) book. it was a great start for me to be familiar with the openai's api and gpt world.
- step 2: i built a [mini-gpt](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/playing-openai-api/blob/main/minigpt.py) locally with [this dataset](https://github.com/Sinusealpha/playing-openai-api/blob/main/dataset.txt) following [andrej karpathy's video](https://youtu.be/kCc8FmEb1nY?si=Mwhe7z8xQezObxqd) on it and it was super-exciting to see that i've built something that is 'generating'!
